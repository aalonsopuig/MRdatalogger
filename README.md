 Datalogger for Multirotor by Alejandro Alonso. July 2015

This is a brick that I developed to take information from temperature, and humidity of different parts of a complex multirotor. The data was sent via ethernet and also recorded on an SD card.
As HW an Arduino uno with an ethernet shield was used.

 Circuit:
 * Ethernet shield attached to pins 10, 11, 12, 13
 * Temperature & humidity
 * PCF8591 ADC with several temp sensors

This repository contains the Software for the Arduino as well as the CAD design for the box containing the hardware.

This is the only picture I have of the unit onboard of a drone prototype
